    "   - What is the overall trend of new cases and new deaths over time?\n",

    "   - How has the number of cumulative cases and cumulative deaths changed over time in different countries or regions?\n",

    "   - Which countries or regions have reported the highest and lowest number of new cases and new deaths?\n",
    "   - How does the distribution of new cases and new deaths vary across different WHO regions?\n",
    "   - Are there specific countries or regions that experienced significant changes in cumulative cases or cumulative deaths during certain periods?\n",

    "3. **Rate of Spread and Mortality:**\n",
    "   - What is the average daily increase in new cases and new deaths globally or within specific regions?\n",
    "   - How does the mortality rate (number of deaths divided by the number of cases) vary across different countries or regions?\n",

    "4. **Regional Comparison:**\n",
    "   - How do different WHO regions compare in terms of new cases, new deaths, and cumulative cases?\n",
    "   - Is there a significant difference in the mortality rate between countries in different WHO regions?\n",

    "5. **Outliers and Anomalies:**\n",
    "   - Are there any outliers in the data, indicating unusually high or low values for new cases, new deaths, or cumulative numbers?\n",
    "   - Can you identify any specific events or factors that might have influenced a sudden spike or drop in new cases or deaths?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Correlations and Relationships:**\n",
    "   - Is there a correlation between the number of new cases and new deaths reported daily?\n",
    "   - How does the number of new cases or deaths correlate with population density or healthcare infrastructure in different countries?\n",

    "7. **Comparative Analysis:**\n",
    "   - How does the COVID-19 situation in different countries compare to their healthcare system's capacity or governmental response measures?\n",
